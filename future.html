<p>This is an idealized page of what I'd hope to do with more time, resources and knowledge.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more that can be done with Gothic novel data:</p>

<p>Patterns of Influence - using network analysis in conjunction with textual analysis and further data collection, we might be able to establish how authors were influenced by each other. For instance, the preface of “The Old English Baron” acknowledges that it’s essentially a retelling of “The Castle of Otranto.” Chapbooks were often blatant abridgements of longer novels, such as The Monk of Udolpho, or “The Abbess” (it’s the Monk but she’s a lady!)</p>

<p>Character names could also indicate patterns of influence: there’s a lot of Matildas and Theodores, and it doesn’t seem like a coincidence. (If the name “Ambrosio” comes up, you know it’s going to be a monk…)</p>

<p>Continuing Tracy’s work into the later Gothic - which motifs were carried on through the late 19th century into the present? Compared to the Romantic Era, Victorian Gothic seems (slightly) more subtle.</p>
