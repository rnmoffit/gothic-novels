<h3>Prelude</h3>
<p>In 2014, Lawrence Evalyn posted an article on The Toast called <a href="https://the-toast.net/2014/09/15/gothic-novel-index/">"The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Index of Motifs"</a>, which highlighted some of the more outlandish motifs that recurred in Gothic novels during the Romantic Era. The source for this article was Ann B. Tracy's 1981 reference work, <i>The Gothic Novel, 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs</i>. Years later, when I started graduate school at UCLA, I found a copy of this book in the library and decided to use the motif index to practice building a relational database (titles in one table, motifs in another, etc.) I was interested in seeing what the most popular motifs were and which books featured the weirdest plot elements. </p>

<h3>Project</h3>
<p>My Digital Humanities class was the perfect opportunity to actually see how this data can be used quantitatively, as well as practice various DH methods. I learned to clean my dataset (which I had transcribed as written in Tracy's book), upload it to Tableau and Flourish, and see what patterns emerged. (I also tried to look at it with Cytoscape and Gephi, but <a href="/future.html">network analysis will have to wait</a>. </p>

<p> However, I also went beyond my original dataset - using the digital versions of the texts to see if there were patterns in language usage or titles, and trying to find out where London publishers were located. I'm not sure if my findings are particularly useful, but it helps.</p>
