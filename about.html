<h3>Prelude</h3>
<p>I read an article on the Toast. Then I tracked down a copy of the book. I used the motif index to practice building databases. I used the datasheets to look at Data Repository Practices.</p>

<h3>Project</h3>
<p>My Digital Humanities class was the perfect opportunity to actually see how this data can be used quantitatively, as well as practice various DH methods. I learned to clean my dataset (which I had transcribed as written in Tracy's book), upload it to Tableau and Flourish, and see what patterns emerged. (I also tried to look at it with Cytoscape and Gephi, but <a href="/future.html">network analysis will have to wait</a>. </p>

<p> However, I also went beyond my original dataset - using the digital versions of the texts to see if there were patterns in language usage or titles, and trying to find out where London publishers were located. I'm not sure if my findings are particularly useful, but it helps.</p>
