<p>Literary trends are nothing new. In the past thirty years, we’ve seen floods of “wizard school” novels, teenage paranormal romances, dystopian science fiction, and psychological thrillers with featuring troubled young women(<i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train</i> -- you get it).</p>

<p>In the late 18th century, the most sensational literary trend was the "Gothic novel." Building off the popularity of the emotionally-driven “sentimental” and “romantic” novels, this genre distinguished itself by adding supernatural elements, callbacks to  and Somewhat related to the "sentimental novel" and the "romantic novel," it distinguished itself by including supernatural elements, historical settings, and high levels of drama. One contemporary writer described the genre in a satirical essay: </p>

<p>This project attempts to visualize some of these trends by processing the data gathered by Ann B. Tracy in her 1981 reference guide, <i>The Gothic Novel 1790--1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs</i>. Using the two hundred and eight novels and chapbooks featured in this work, this project aims to explore the kinds of data visualizations, maps, and textual analyses a bibliographic index can provide. </p>

      <p>Along with exploring Tracy’s corpus, we will pay closer attention to the four novels that played a key role in shaping the Gothic genre for decades to come (which we will refer to as our “key players):</p>

          <h3>The Castle of Otranto<br/><small>Horace Walpole</small></h3>
          <p>Widely acknowledged as the first official Gothic novel (mostly due to its second edition bearing the subtitle “A Gothic Story”), this short, melodramatic, action-packed novel combines medievalism, long-lost relatives, and supernatural armor. </p>

<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>To modern eyes, these novels are melodramatic, bordering on the ridiculous. But like over-the-top runway looks that rarely make it to department stores as-is, selected elements can be used to great effect in other works. We would not have <i>Wuthering Heights, The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dracula,</i> and hundreds of other popular stories without the influx of Gothic tales in the late 18th century.</p>
