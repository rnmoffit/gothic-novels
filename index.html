<p>The English novel as we know it emerged in the 18th century. Human nature being what it is, it didn't take long for it to devoleve into something we might consider "trashy" - the "sensational" novel. Add elements of the supernatural and the psychological, and what we know as the "gothic" novel was born.</p>

<p>The dataset has 208 novels and chapbooks (abridged versions/shortened rip-offs of popular stories). Flipping through the summaries, it becomes apparent that many of these stories "borrow" plot elements, settings, and characters from each other.</p>

<h3>Our Key Players</h3>
<p>During this time, there are four novels that are recognized today as ground-breakers for the genre:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Castle of Otranto</b></li>
  <li><b>Mysteries of Udolpho</b></li>
  <li><b>The Monk</b></li>
  <li><b>Frankenstein</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Jane Austen parodies the genre in <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, in which the main character reads too many gothic novels (all of which are represented in the data set) and believes she is the heroine in the middle of a foreboding adventure. Austen mentions the distain some people have for the genre, but that they are popular for a reason.</p>

<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>To modern eyes, these novels are melodramatic, bordering at the ridiculous. Out of all the books in the data set, only Frankenstein has remained popular into the 21st century. But like over-the-top runway looks that rarely make it to stores in their original form, selected elements can be used in other works to great effect. We would not have <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>Dracula</i>, and hundreds of other popular stories without this influx of Gothic tales in the late 18th century.</p>
