<p>Literary trends are nothing new. We can recall the spate of "wizard school" novels emerging in the late 1990s, the flood of paranormal romances in the mid-2000s, and the psychological thrillers with "Girl" in the title that have <i>finally</i> seem to have died down. (<i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train</i> -- you get it.</p>

<p>In the late 18th century, the hottest literary trend was the "Gothic novel." Somewhat related to the "sentimental novel" and the "romantic novel," it distinguished itself by including supernatural elements, callbacks to historical times, and high levels of emotion. In fact, one anonymous writer wrote a contemporary recipe for such a novel:</p>

<p>In The Gothic Novel, Ann B Tracy summarizes 208 novels and chapbooks (abridged versions bordering on plagiarism) within a specific time frame, and assembled an index of motifs that are shared. Using her work as a dataset, this project explores what kinds of data visualizations can emerge from literary works.</p>
<p>There are some limitations however. This is one person's interpretation of the genre - other people might have used different categories, or chosen to include or exclude certain works. (Tracy writes that she made no distinction between "Gothic variations" or novels that bordered on "sentimentalism".) I have chosen to use the motif index as written rather than group motifs into larger categories.</p>
<p>Amongst the 208 novels, there are four that have permanent places in the English Gothic canon that shaped the genre for years to come. We can compare them to the general works to see how well they fit among the general corpus, or how unique they are in comparison.</p>

<p>**The English novel as we know it emerged in the 18th century. Human nature being what it is, it didn't take long for it to devolve into something we might consider "trashy" - the "sensational" novel, or the "romantic" novel. Add elements of the supernatural and the psychological, and what we know as the "gothic" novel was born.</p>

<p>**The dataset has 208 novels and chapbooks (abridged versions/shortened rip-offs of popular stories). Flipping through the summaries, it becomes apparent that many of these stories "borrow" plot elements, settings, and characters from each other.</p>

<p>Jane Austen parodies the genre in <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, in which the main character reads too many gothic novels (all of which are represented in the data set) and believes she is the heroine in the middle of a foreboding adventure. Austen mentions the distain some people have for the genre, but that they are popular for a reason.</p>

<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>To modern eyes, these novels are melodramatic, bordering at the ridiculous. Out of all the books in the data set, only Frankenstein has remained popular into the 21st century. But like over-the-top runway looks that rarely make it to stores in their original form, selected elements can be used in other works to great effect. We would not have <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>Dracula</i>, and hundreds of other popular stories without this influx of Gothic tales in the late 18th century.</p>
